# Final_Project

### Analyzing motor vehicle accident data in Austin.
- Using a variety of tools, we will look at how different factors may contribute to the severity of a car crash.

## Reason for Selecting Topic
- We want to build a model that will predict the severity of crash depending on different factors. 
- This information can be used by car insurance companies and by consumers who are trying to shop for cars keeping safety in mind.

## Description of the Source Data
TxDot Crash Query System -- This database uses a multitude of factors to input details on a car accident including but not limited to:
- Weather, longitutde, latitutde, severity, time and date of accident over the course of many years. 
- For the sake of our analysis, we will only use data from 2018-2020.
Additionally, we used NHTSA WebAPIs - https://one.nhtsa.gov/webapi/Default.aspx?SafetyRatings/API/5
- This webAPI gives access to the New Car Assessment Program - 5 Star Safety Rating of the US Department Of Transportation, to retrieve overall safety ratings of the cars involved in the crashes.

## Questions we hope to answer with the data
- How do different cars perform in terms of frequency and severity of car accidents?
- How do different weather types affect the frequency of car accidents?
- How demographics affect frequency of car accidents?
- Where do most accidents occur in Austin?

## Communication Protocols
-  Any other questions or concerns that arise outside of my daily check-ins, I tackle during (or after) class, our group Zoom meetings, or even during weekly TA sessions.
